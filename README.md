# Kanaizu

This is a simple quiz app that I made as an excuse to try Routify/Svelte and to help my friend memorise Japanese kana. It's not perfect but it's quite usable. Currently there are 508 hiragana and katakana.

I got the name **Kanaizu** by combining **Kana** and **Quiz**. Yeah, it might sound stupid but meh, I never good at naming stuff so it is what it is.
